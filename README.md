This is a financial dataset of various individuals which tell us how much money they make in a year given their career background lifestyle status etc.
So from machine learning point of view we followed normal EDA process and no additional feature column integrated. Using optuna method and super learning ml technique
we achieved accuracy of 0.87 which was optimized based on accuracy metric and f1 score of 0.71 which was optimized based on the f1 score. The super learner consisted ml
algorithms of namely bc, lgb, xgb, rf, dt and knn
